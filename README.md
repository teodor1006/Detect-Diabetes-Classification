# Detect-Diabetes-Classification
This project aims to predict diabetes using various machine learning classification algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, RandomForestClassifier, and Support Vector Machines (SVM). The workflow consists of exploratory analysis on the dataset, building the model using StandardScaler for feature scaling, applying the classification algorithms, hyperparameter tuning for the best model (SVM), evaluating the model using confusion matrices, classification reports, and ROC curves, and finally making predictions for testing the model.
