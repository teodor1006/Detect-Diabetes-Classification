# Detect-Diabetes-Classification
This project aims to predict diabetes using various machine learning classification algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, RandomForestClassifier, and Support Vector Machines (SVM). The workflow consists of exploratory analysis on the dataset, building the model using StandardScaler for feature scaling, applying the classification algorithms, hyperparameter tuning for the best model (SVM), evaluating the model using confusion matrices, classification reports, and ROC curves, and finally making predictions for testing the model.

# Dataset
The dataset employed in this project contains relevant information pertaining to diabetes. It encompasses various features such as age, body mass index (BMI), blood pressure, and glucose levels. The dataset has been preprocessed and prepared for analysis.

# Exploratory Analysis
Prior to constructing the prediction models, an exploratory analysis has been conducted on the dataset. This analysis aids in comprehending the data distribution, identifying patterns and detecting any outliers or missing values. Exploratory data analysis offers valuable insights that inform subsequent feature selection and preprocessing steps.

# Model Building
To create the diabetes prediction model, the dataset is divided into training and testing sets. StandardScaler is utilized to scale the features and render them comparable. Subsequently, multiple machine learning classification algorithms, such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, RandomForestClassifier, and SVM, are employed to train the models.

# Model Evaluation
The accuracy of the models is evaluated using a variety of metrics. Initially, confusion matrices are generated for both the training and testing sets, providing an overview of the model's performance in terms of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives. Subsequently, classification reports are generated, encompassing metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and support. These reports offer a comprehensive assessment of the model's performance for each class. Finally, the ROC curve is plotted to visualize the receiver operating characteristic curve, which illustrates the trade-off between the true positive rate and false positive rate.

# Model Improvement
Based on the initial evaluation, the SVM algorithm exhibits the highest accuracy among the classification models. Consequently, hyperparameter tuning is performed specifically for SVM to further optimize the model's performance. By fine-tuning the hyperparameters, the model's ability to predict diabetes can be enhanced.

# Predictions
To validate the efficacy of the developed model, predictions are made on unseen data. This enables testing of the model's performance in real-world scenarios and determination of its reliability for practical applications.
