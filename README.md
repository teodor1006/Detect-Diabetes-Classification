# Detect-Diabetes-Classification
This project introduces a Graphical User Interface (GUI) to predict diabetes using a variety of machine learning classification algorithms. The workflow encompasses exploratory data analysis, feature scaling with StandardScaler, application of classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, RandomForestClassifier and Support Vector Machines (SVM), hyperparameter tuning for optimizing the SVM model, model evaluation through confusion matrices, classification reports, and ROC curves, and ultimately making predictions for testing the model.
